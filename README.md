 ### Data preparation and cleaning

 In the data set there were no errors foud in the data set,from the initial inspection of the dataset I found out  that the data was already in a good condition
 there were no missing values, duplicates, or any errors found across the dataset's 999+ rows,each entry was neatly recorded,and no efforts were made to clean the dataset.
 there were no visible white spaces, had good coloum distribution and quality  in the dataset. This allowed us to go straight into exploratory data analysis and modeling, saving 
 valuable time and resources. Itâ€™s rare to find a dataset that's so well-prepared, and this provided
 a solid foundation for the data analysis.
 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the car data answer key questions, such as:

-What is the price of cars by make

- How many kilometers were driven

 ### Results and findings

The analysis includes various insights and trends observed from the OLX car agency data. Some key findings are:

-There were about over 15 car make found in the data set, and only about a few were selected based on there price which sumed to the top 5 car makes which were:Toyota($4,925,319,743),Honda( $4,577,974,895),Suzuki( $4,350,006,491),Daihatsu($2,242,995,997),Changan($588,034,000), to give the prices by make

-The distribution of car prices across different locations were calculated at large, and car prices valued at 2,250 with the highest  location (Karachi) and the rest followed suit in that order above were the top 10 best sellers based on the location using the kilometers driven and other proxies to ascertain it.

-There were only 4 fuel types covered in this data set and Petrol which was has the highest was about 8,785 car types that covered it and the least which were Diesel and Hybrid which were used by 1 car each respectively in this dataset.

-The transmission of various cars affected the car prices based their automatic and mannual transmission type, with Automatic covering about 39% and Manual covering about 61% of the car data set. 

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

-Priceing of cars is competitively by analyzing  prices of similar makes at various location to rest to the best sellers rated

-Compare the top 10 listings across various locations to find the best car by transmissiom

-Check the car's manufacturing year and kilometers driven for each car listed for a better understanding of its car value

-Highlight unique features and well-maintained conditions to stand out as a car.
